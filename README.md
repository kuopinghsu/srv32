# SRV32 - Simple 3-stage pipeline RISC-V processor

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d14f73089d014a87beb91960e9340617)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/kuopinghsu/srv32/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=kuopinghsu/srv32&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a simple RISC-V 3-stage pipeline processor and supports FreeRTOS.
I wrote this code to understand the RV32IM instruction set, just for fun.
The performance is 1.945 DMIPS/MHz and 3.170 Coremark/MHz.
This is not a RISC-V core available for production.

## Features

1.  Three-stage pipeline processor
2.  RV32IM/RV32E instruction sets
3.  Pass RV32IM [architecture test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test)
4.  Trap exception
5.  Interrupt handler
6.  [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/kuopinghsu/FreeRTOS-RISCV) support
7.  ISS simulator

## Pre-requisite tools

### Building toolchains

Install RISCV toolchains.

    # Ubuntu packages needed:
    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev \
        libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo \
        gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev git libexpat1-dev python3 \
        python-is-python3 lcov ninja-build device-tree-compiler
    
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
    cd riscv-gnu-toolchain

    mkdir build; cd build

    ../configure --prefix=/opt/riscv \
       --with-isa-spec=20191213 \
       --with-multilib-generator="\
         rv32im_zicsr-ilp32--;\
         rv32imac_zicsr-ilp32--;\
         rv32im_zicsr_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs-ilp32--;\
         rv32imac_zicsr_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs-ilp32--;\
         rv32em_zicsr-ilp32e--;\
         rv32emac_zicsr-ilp32e--"

    make -j$(nproc)

Note: change the default ISA to 20191213, refer to [RISC-V GNU toolchain bumping default ISA spec to 20191213](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/g/sw-dev/c/aE1ZeHHCYf4) for detail.

Note: To build the Zba/Zbb/Zbc/Zbs extension, you must use the gcc-13 branch or latter, otherwise a build error will occur. Or if the B extension is not used, remove the corresponding multilib.

The default tools uses riscv64-unknown-elf-. If you would like to use others toolchains, you can define an environment to override it. For example,

    export CROSS_COMPILE=riscv-none-elf-

Therefore, you can use [The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack) instead of building a toolchain yourself.
It has been changed to default ISA spec to 20192013, but it does not include rv32im_zicsr multlib.
The workaround is using -misa-spec=2.2 to force RISC-V GCC using the older ISA spec version.
Adding extra CFLAGS as follows.

    export EXTRA_CFLAGS="-misa-spec=2.2 -march=rv32im"

### Run the RISC-V architectural tests

## RTL Simulation

Support Verilator (default) and Icarus Verilog.

To run Verilator,

    # Ubuntu package needed to run the RTL simulation
    sudo apt install verilator
    
    # Modify the Makefile, and set verilator ?= 1
    vim sim/Makefile
    or
    make verilator=1

To run Icarus Verilog,

    # Ubuntu package needed to run the RTL simulation
    sudo apt install iverilog
    
    # Modify the Makefile, and set verilator ?= 0
    vim sim/Makefile
    or
    make verilator=0

Only running make without parameters will get help.

    $ make
    make all         build all diags and run the RTL sim
    make all-sw      build all diags and run the ISS sim
    make tests-all   run all diags and compliance test
    make coverage    generate code coverage report
    make build       build all diags and the RTL
    make dhrystone   build Dhrystone diag and run the RTL sim
    make coremark    build Coremark diag and run the RTL sim
    make clean       clean
    make distclean   clean all

    rv32c=1          enable RV32C (default off)
    rv32e=1          enable RV32E (default off)
    debug=1          enable waveform dump (default off)
    coverage=1       enable coverage test (default off)
    test_v=[2|3]     run test compliance v2 or v3 (default)

    For example

    make tests-all             run all tests with test compliance (default v3)
    make test_v=2 tests-all    run all tests with test compliance v2
    make coverage=1 tests-all  run all tests with code coverage report
    make debug=1 hello         run hello with waveform dump
    make rv32e=1 dhrystone     run dhrystone for RV32E config

Supports following parameter when running the simulation.

    Usage: sim [+help] [+no-meminit] [+dump] [+trace] [prog.elf]

        +help         usage help
        +no-meminit   memory uninitialized
        +dump         dump vcd file
        +trace        generate trace log

For example, following command will generate the VCD dump.

    cd sim && ./sim +dump

Use +trace to generate a trace log, which can be compared with the log file of the ISS simulator to ensure that the RTL simulation is correct.

    cd sim && ./sim +trace

The RTL passes rv32i_m/I and rv32i_m/M arch-tests.

## ISS (Instruction Set Simulator)

The rvsim is an instruction set simulator (ISS) that can generate trace logs for comparison with RTL simulation results. It can also set parameters of branch penalty to run benchmarks to see the effect of branch penalty. The branch instructions of hardware is two instructions delay for branch penalties.

    Instruction Set Simulator for RV32IM, (c) 2020 Kuoping Hsu
    Usage: rvsim [-h] [-d] [-g port] [-m n] [-n n] [-b n] [-p] [-l logfile] file

        --help, -h              help
        --debug, -d             interactive debug mode
        --gdb port, -g port     enable gdb debugger with port
        --quiet, -q             quite
        --membase n, -m n       memory base
        --memsize n, -n n       memory size for iram and dram each (in Kb)
        --branch n, -b n        branch penalty (default 2)
        --single, -s            single RAM
        --predict, -p           static branch prediction
        --log file, -l file     generate log file

        file                    the elf executable file

The ISS simulator supports RV32IMCZicsr_Zba_Zbb_Zbc_Zbs instruction sets. It passes the following arch-tests.

*  rv32i_m/B
*  rv32i_m/C
*  rv32i_m/I
*  rv32i_m/M
*  rv32i_m/privilege

### Running with gdb debugger

Start rvsim with '-g 1234' to start gdbstub in port 1234.

```
$ ./rvsim -g 1234 ../sw/hello/hello.elf

## Cycles per Instruction Performance

Two instructions branch penalty if branch taken, CPI is 1 for other instructions. The average Cycles per Instruction (CPI) is approximately 1.3 on Dhrystone diag.

This core is three-stage pipeline processors, which is Fetch & Decode (F/D), execution (E) and write back (WB).

*   Register Forwarding

The problem with data hazards, introduced by this sequence of instructions can be solved with a simple hardware technique called forwarding. When the execution result accesses the same register, the execution result is directly forwarded to the next instruction.

<img src="images/forwarding.svg" alt="Register Forwarding" width=320>

*   Branch Penalty

When the branch is taken during the execute phase, it needs to flush the instructions that have been fetched into the pipeline, which causes a delay of two instructions, so the extra cost of the branch is two.

<img src="images/branch.svg" alt="Branch Penalty" width=320>

## Memory Interface

One instruction memory and one data memory. The instruction memory is read-only for one read port, while data memory is two port, one for reading and one for writing.

## Synthesis

Provide the Yosys synthesis script in the syn folder.

## Architectural testing

Architecture test for ISS simulator and RTL. This is the architecture test form RISC-V Foundation Compliance Task Group.

The older 2.x version of the framework was based on Makefile. This is no longer officially supported, but the environment is simpler (no need to install RISCOF) and runs faster. The [RISCOF](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the current version of the architectural framework.

The github repository is at [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test). Running the following command will clone the repository into tests folder and do the compliance test.

    make tests              # run the compliance test for RTL
    make tests-sw           # run the compliance test for ISS simulator

Default is to run compliance test v3, run the following command to run compliance test v2.

    make test_v=2 tests     # run the compliance test for RTL
    make test_v=2 tests-sw  # run the compliance test for ISS simulator

Notes: no complicance test for RV32E configuration.

## FreeRTOS support

Reference code on [FreeRTOS-RISCV](https://github.com/kuopinghsu/FreeRTOS-RISCV).

    # build FreeRTOS and demo
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kuopinghsu/FreeRTOS-RISCV
    cd FreeRTOS-RISCV && make

This is an example to run the "queue" demo.

    # make directory
    mkdir ${path_of_srv32}/sw/queue

    # copy queue.elf
    cp Demo/examples/queue.elf ${path_of_srv32}/sw/queue/.

    # update the example in sw folder
    cd ${path_of_srv32}/sw && make update

    # run the example for RTL and ISS simulator
    cd ${path_of_srv32} && make queue

## Coverage Report

    # Ubuntu package needed to generate coverage report
    sudo apt install lcov

Following command will generate the code coverage report in coverage/html
directory.

    % make coverage

This is the coverage report of RTL by lcov, which get 100% code coverage.

<img src="images/coverage.svg" alt="coverage" width=480>

This is the coverage report of ISS.

<img src="images/coverage_iss.svg" alt="coverage-ISS" width=480>

## Known issues

*   Memory can not respond non-valid, that is, the memory should always accept the command from CPU.

## TO-DO

*   merge the memory interface into one memory for one port
*   static branch predictor
*   support RV32C compress extension
*   serial multiplier and divider
*   Nuttx & Zephyr porting
